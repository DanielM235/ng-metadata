# TODO app 

Here is an example app, how to write component oriented code with angular 1 + Typescript + ng-metadata.

Architecture is separated on smart + dumb components + composition.

There is only one Smart component: 
- `todo-app`

All others are dump.
- `<add-todo>`
- `<todo-list>`
- `todo-item`

We are using also pipe to showcase `@Pipe` usage. It could have been also component.
- `remainigTodos`

Here UI mockup with components described:
